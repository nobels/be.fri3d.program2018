<p>Asyncio is the new approach introduced in Python 3 for dealing with asynchronous inputs and outputs (eg: a chat server with many people talking at the same time).</p>
<p>This workshop will help you grasp the different concepts (coroutine, event loop, ...) and apply them on practical examples.</p>
